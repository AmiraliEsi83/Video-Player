## Thoughts
 It is a basic video player that plays the one video I supplied. There is fullscreen functionality, volume & mute, playback speed, and play and pause. I can see how this project could be expanded even more to basically make a YouTube clone. I think that that is an ambitious project though! Could be something interesting for me to do in the future.

## My Enhancements

- When a user mutes the video then unmutes, the icon will show at full volume no matter what. So if the user had it set to a very low volume, clicks mute, then clicks to unmute, the volume will still be at the low volume, but the icon will be the full volume icon. _I made the change where the icon will match whatever the user had the volume set to._
- I turned the list of element constants in the JS file, into an object.
